# Discover WV's Newest Water Trail

Discover and explore the Buckhannon & Tygart Valley River Water Trail, a 45-mile water trail in north-central WV, offering outstanding scenic and recreational opportunities!

Two rivers. Two cities. Two counties. One trail. The Buckhannon & Tygart Valley River Water Trail flows through peaceful landscapes, quiet meanders, and mature forested landscapes, as well as communities rich in history, including two historic covered bridges. Wildlife is plentiful along the entire waterway. The region is rich in social, cultural, and historical heritage. There are a few short sections of Class I/II water for more experienced paddlers to explore. The trail begins near the community of Sago in Upshur County and ends near Arden in Barbour County. The trail flows through the cities of Buckhannon and Philippi.

## Public Access 
There are 11 public access sites along the BTV Water Trail that allow safe access to the riverway. The [BTV Water Trail Map & Guide](/access-maps-guides) highlights these access sites and other key features along the river. In the coming years, our team of river stewards aim to create additional river access points and improve existing sites. 

## Floating by Canoe, Kayak, SUP, or Tube 
The BTV Water Trail offers beautiful scenery, with miles of beginner and family friendly flat water. Other sections have exciting Class I and Class II rapids. Be sure to practice safe boating practices: wear a personal floatation device, check river conditions prior to floating, and have a guide and map on any new section you want to explore.

## Fishing
Smallmouth bass, crappie, sunfish, suckers and even muskie call the Buckhannon and Tygart Rivers home. Any fisher over 14 years old will need a [WVDNR fishing license.](https://www.wvhunt.com/login)

## Relax & Slow Down 
However you chose to enjoy the river, be sure to slow down, relax, and soak in the scenery. Life along the river is an ever changing play: breezes flow through the tree and brush across your skin, sunlight changes as clouds dance overhead, sounds echo as birds call out and wildlife splashes in the water. The BTV Water Trail wants you to join in and enjoy the peaceful setting. And needs you to preserve and protect these unique rivers and habitats. 

## Scenery & Wildlife
Deer, turkey, beaver, herons, otters, kingfishers and bald eagles are often sighted on quiet floats. Around each river bend is the possibility of a new discovery!

## History & Culture 
Discover unique and interesting historical and cultural points of interest. The Water Trail tells an interconnected story of the natural landscape and its flora/fauna, as well as human culture, heritage, and history. Two covered bridges. Pringle Tree. And numerous other gems. 

## Conservation & Stewardship 
The BTV Water Trail tells an interconnected story of the river and land, its
flora and fauna, as well as our own heritage and history. We hope the BTV Water Trail helps enhance connection, foster stewardship, and spark appreciation of the natural World. The Water Trail is an outdoor classroom without walls. We invite you to get outside, explore, and connect with nature.
