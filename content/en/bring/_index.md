<!--
Although not exhaustive, please review this recommended list: 
- Food & Drink: Make sure you have an appropriate amount of each for the trip and stay hydrated. Avoid drinking river or stream water! Alcoholic beverages and boating don’t mix and can be dangerous.
- Waterproof dry bags/containers: Anything you take is likely to get wet. Place cameras and cell phones in dry bags or waterproof boxes and secure them to the boat.
- Leave No Trace: If you pack it in, pack it out. Stay off private property and respect all wildlife. 
- Fishing: If you are going fishing, be sure to have your West Virginia fishing license on hand at all times.
- Life Jacket: Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs) are as necessary as a paddle in every boat. The best and safest practice is to wear your PFD at all times. The law requires that a Coast Guard Approved PFD be available for every person in the boat.
- River Map: Make sure you know where you are at all times – you don’t want to miss your takeout. A downloadable and print-ready version of the water trail map is available here.
- Footwear: Appropriate foot wear, such as securely strapped sandals or even old tennis shoes, can keep a day on the river fun instead of miserable. Pieces of glass and rusty metal can be found in every river. If you have to get out of your boat to pull it through a shallow area, having sturdy footwear (NOT flipflops) will not only keep you safe but protect your feet from slippery, sharp rocks or old fishing hooks!
- Clothing: Dress appropriately for the weather. Wearing a hat and/or using sunscreen can help you avoid a sunburn. In cooler weather, the threat for hypothermia is greater. A towel and an extra set of dry clothes, either in a vehicle at the takeout OR sealed in a waterproof bag, can make a trip much more comfortable!
