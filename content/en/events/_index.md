## Jack Barker Memorial Race & Fun Paddle
The Jack Barker Memorial Fun Paddle & Race is an annual kick off celebration that marks the beginning of summer. Held each May, paddlers and families gather at Buckhannon Riverwalk to enjoy a day on the water. This event has a long history and has been held as part of the WV Strawberry Festival for decades. The event honors the life and legacy of Jack Barker, an avid canoe paddler, national caliber racer and champion, and lover of the Buckhannon River. This event is organized by the Buckhannon River Watershed Association.

## Buckhannon RiverFest
Each year, the Mountain Lakes Preservation Alliance and the Buckhannon River Watershed Association co-organize this free annual community gathering. The all-day celebrations kick off with a community paddle on the Buckhannon River from Hampton to Riverwalk on Saturday morning and continues with music, food, vendors, education activities, and more at Riverwalk Park. Buckhannon RiverFest is held annually to celebrate clean water, healthy recreation, and our community. The Buckhannon River is the only municipal source of drinking water in Upshur County, and we must do everything we can to protect it. This event started in 2016 and was founded by, and is now held in memory of, April Pierson Keating, a local advocate for healthier environments and communities.
