# History & Culture

{{< intro >}}
The region is rich in social, cultural, and historical heritage. Many indigenous tribes used this area for hunting and gathering, as well as traveling between other lands. Calicuas, Massawomek, Shawandasse, Sâ€™atsoyaha, and Osage are among the many indigenous tribes that are recognized to have lived in this area. Buckongahelas of the Lenape Delaware tribe traveled from what is now considered Delaware eastward, and lived for a time in the area that is now Buckhannon in Upshur County, WV.

Samuel and John Pringle were the first European settlers of Upshur County, arriving in 1762 and living along the Buckhannon River. The brothers even hid in a giant hollow Sycamore for two years evading the British Army. The Monongahela River and its upper tributaries were the main highways for European settlement in the coming decades. After more settlers arrived, several small communities were formed along the Buckhannon River. The land was cleared for farming, and the timber was used to build rail lines. As communities grew, lumbering became the primary industry and several grist mills were constructed. Today, ghost towns are common along the Buckhannon River where mills once stood including Beans Mill and Ours Mills. In the early stages of the Civil War during the summer of 1861, many troops were stationed in the Buckhannon/Philippi region. The Battle of Philippi occurred on June 3, 1861 and is recognized as the first organized land battle of the Civil War. At the turn of the twentieth century, the coal industry began to grow leading to many large deep mines and strip mines. The oil and gas industry began to grow a few decades later. 

The rich human history in the region has negatively impacted the environment and natural resources in the watershed. For over two decades, concerned citizens of Save the Tygart Watershed Association and Buckhannon River Watershed Association have focused grassroots efforts to improve water quality. Many conservation threats still remain. Restoration and protection of the riverway is an on-going effort.
