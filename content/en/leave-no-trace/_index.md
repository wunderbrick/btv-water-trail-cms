Take nothing but pictures and leave only footprints. Leave No Trace is an outdoor ethics framework to protect the natural world. When we recreate outdoors, we must take actions to minimize our impacts.

<!--
You can help protect our Water Trail by following these principles:
- Plan Ahead And Prepare: Spend time researching river conditions and special concerns for the area you’ll visit. Carry the proper equipment and prepare for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies.
- Use Durable Surfaces: Protect vulnerable riparian habitats by traveling on durable surfaces: rock, gravel, or established paths. 
- Dispose of Waste Properly: Pack it in, pack it out. Pack out all trash, leftover food and litter. Use restrooms pre/post trip to dispose of solid waste. 
- Leave What You Find: Leave rocks, plants and other natural objects as you find them. Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species. Do not build structures or stack rocks. 
- Minimize Campfire Impact: No fires are permitted along the riverway. 
- Respect Wildlife: Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow or approach them. Never feed animals. Feeding wildlife damages their health, alters natural behaviors, and exposes them to predators and other dangers.
- Be Considerate of Others: Respect other visitors and protect the quality of their experience. Let nature’s sounds prevail. Avoid loud voices and noises.

In addition to Leave No Trace principles, you can go green in other ways to help protect the river. The choices you make every day impact rivers indirectly and directly, in ways you may not even think about. Consider living an environmentally conscious lifestyle to lessen these impacts and to free up extra cash for that new boat or paddle. Carpool to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on acid precipitation and global warming. Conserve water in your home, yard, and garden to keep aquifers and rivers more fully charged. Reduce your electricity consumption to reduce your support of mining and hydro development. Recycle to decrease national energy needs, mining, and logging.
