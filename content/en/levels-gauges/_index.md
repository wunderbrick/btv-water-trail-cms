# Water Levels & Gauges

## Safety First  
You are responsible for your own safety. Know your abilities and the abilities of your group. The links in the table below are for your reference before heading out on the rivers. Proper planning and alertness to your surroundings are key to safe paddling. 

## River Levels  
River conditions can vary greatly along the 45-mile Riverway due to precipitation, season, dams, impoundments, and other features. The river responds quickly to rain events. High water levels change river conditions and flow patterns and may make it unsuitable for inexperienced paddlers. The Water Trail is also impacted by drought, which creates shallow scrappy conditions for paddlers.  

River users should always:  
- Consult the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website (links in table below);
- Contact the outfitter if using one for rental of equipment and/or shuttling with site specific questions; or
- Contact someone with knowledge of the current condition. Ask a question on our facebook group, check out previous trip reports, or contact us with questions.  

The automated USGS river level stations usually show two graphs, gauge height and discharge. The table below has the link to the river levels, water temperature as well as High and Normal levels.  
- Gauge Height: The height of the water in the river above a reference point. Gauge height refers to the elevation of the water surface in the specific pool at the gauge station, not along the entire river. 
- Discharge: This is the volume of water moving past a certain point, measured in cubic feet per second (CFS). In general, the larger the volume, the faster water is moving downstream.
