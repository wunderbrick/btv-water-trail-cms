## Section 2: North Buckhannon Park to Hall Road
Downstream of North Buckhannon Park the river flows through beautiful rural scenery, alternating between mature forest and pasture. This section offers excellent scenic and wildlife viewing opportunities as paddlers leave the city of Buckhannon. The river passes under the U.S. Route 33 bridge and under the Post Mill Road bridge. In this section, the river is mostly slow and shallow, with some deep pools and very short segments of flowing rifles. Pringle Tree Park appears on river left after 3.75 miles from North Buckhannon Park. 

The river lazily flows past Pringle Tree Park and passes under Post Mill Road for a second time, along with two other small railroad bridges. The River Road Public Access site appears on river right 1.25 miles after Pringle Tree Park. Downstream, the river continues through long, deep pools interspersed with short rifles for 4 miles to Hall Road South Access Site. In this section, the river regains its natural flow characteristics as large in-stream boulders become visible.  


Section Length: 9 miles  
Class: Flatwater & Class I  
Level: Beginner friendly

## Section 3: Hall Road to Boulder (9.5 miles)

After the Hall Road Access Site, the river meanders for 7 miles to the access site at Hall. This section is remote and is one of the longest distances between access sites along the Water Trail. The river flows through numerous meanders and passes through an especially scenic forest gorge. Sand Run, a tributary, enters on river right, and then the river passes through the Wentz Ford community. After passing through this small residential area, the river gradient increases slightly as the slow pools are replaced with Class I riffles and rock gardens before passing under Hall Road. After Hall Road, the river resumes its leisurely character for 2.5 miles to Audra Park Road Bridge at Boulder. Just upstream of Boulder, a small Class I riffle and rock garden segment appear.


Section Length: 9.5 miles  
Class: Class I  
Level: Beginner friendly

## Section 4: Boulder to Philippi (10.8) 
Downstream of Boulder, the Buckhannon River slowly flows through quiet meanders. Approximately 4 miles downstream of Boulder, the river gradient increases. This section is the most difficult and remote section of the Water Trail and contains Class I and Class II rapids. Only experienced paddlers are advised to paddle this section. This section provides excellent scenic and wildlife viewing opportunities, as well as historical points of interest (two covered bridges). As the river flows through Carrolton, Class I/II rapids continue ¾ mile to the Buckhannon and Tygart River confluence. Downstream of the confluence, the gradient decreases and alternatures through shallow runs and deep pools. Here, the river flows through the tailend of the remote Tygart Gorge. As the river appears in Philippi, a low-head dam appears just upstream of the Philippi Covered Bridge. 

Section Length: 10.8 miles  
Class: Class I/II  
Level: Experienced paddlers only

## Section 5: Philippi to Arden
Downstream of Philippi, the river flows through a scenic and flatwater 3 mile stretch. Then, the river gradient increases and a 1 mile section of Class I/Class II rapids exist upstream of Arden. This more difficult section can be avoided by taking out at the Felton Road access site. The Water Trail ends at Arden. Downstream of the Arden bridge, the Tygart River continues a tumultuous journey through extreme whitewater. 

Section Length: 7.2 miles  
Class: Flatwater and Class I/II  
Level: First 3 miles beginner friendly, last 4 miles experienced paddlers only
