# Nature & Wildlife

{{< img src="/img/Musky.webp" height="100vw">}}

Mature forested communities dominate the riparian area along the riverway. Large maples, black cherry, ash, elms, and sycamore trees stand tall along the river banks. Numerous types of wildlife and fish call the river and the surrounding riparian area home. Birds utilize the river as a corridor, and the tall mature trees along the river are used as habitat. Hawks, king fishers, blue and green herons, wood ducks, mallards, and bald eagles are commonly seen while paddling. Mammals such as chipmunk, squirrel, river otter, groundhog, muskrat, and foxes can also be seen scurrying along the river banks or swimming in the water. In the warmer weather, turtles, frogs, and salamanders bask in the sun, and butterflies, dragonflies, and damselflies can be heard buzzing around. Spring ephemerals and summer wildflowers are especially plentiful alongside the river. Fishing opportunities are also excellent. The Buckhannon River is well-known as one of the best locations for musky fishing in the state. The WVDNR stocks brook, brown, and rainbow trout twice a year on a 20 mile segment of the Buckhannon River. Other common fish include smallmouth and largemouth bass, and bluegill.
