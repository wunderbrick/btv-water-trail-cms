# The Trail

{{< intro >}}
The Buckhannon and Tygart Valley River Water Trail is a 45 mile route originating near Sago in Upshur County and ending near Arden in Barbour County. The Water Trail includes approximately 30 miles of the Buckhannon River and 15 miles of the Tygart Valley River. The trail is mostly flatwater with occasional riffles, offering excellent beginner and family friendly routes. The proposed Water Trail flows through peaceful landscapes, quiet meanders, and mature forested landscapes, as well as communities rich in history, including two historic covered bridges.

The BTV Water Trail is officially designated as a WV Water Trail by the WV Recreational Trail Advisory Board. The Water Trail was approved for designation in December 2024 after nearly a year-long planning, assessment, and application process. 

The Buckhannon River Watershed Association (BRWA) and Save the Tygart Watershed
Association (STTWA) are the primary co-sponsors for the BTV Water Trail. Both BRWA and STTWA are 501(c)3 non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting and restoring our local waterways. BRWA and STTWA cohesively believe our waterways are major natural assets, and our need for clean water should be a source of community unity. Both organizations have been working for decades to restore and promote the outstanding potential of our waterways. Both organizations have implemented and maintained numerous acid mine drainage treatment systems, as well as other clean water protection projects to restore our rivers for the enjoyment of all. We hope the establishment of a Water Trail can be a way to enhance recreational opportunities and general appreciation of the river, leading to increased support of conservation efforts.  

A Water Trail is a sponsored and maintained recreational route along a waterway that is promoted by local entities with publicly accessible access points. The Water Trail is a navigable route for canoes, kayaks, stand up paddle boards, and other non-motorized recreational boaters. Along the way, there is a network of publicly accessible areas where river users can park vehicles and access the river. River access sites are spaced apart so that the section of river may be paddled in a few hours or a full day (3 - 7 miles apart). The Water Trail provides a unique perspective to experience the landscape from the riverâ€™s view, while enjoying scenic, educational, historical, and cultural points of interest. A Water Trail promotes Leave No Trace principle, respect for private landowners, proper river safety, and fishing and boating regulations.
