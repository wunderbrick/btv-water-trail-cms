# Watershed & River Profiles

Both the Buckhannon and Tygart Valley Rivers originate in the elevated Allegheny mountains of central West Virginia. Both rivers flow through the Forested Hills and Mountain ecoregion. Characterized by rugged topography and rich woodlands, numerous small tributaries carve the crumbled landscapes and feed the mainstem rivers that are guarded by steep slopes and exposed cliff faces. Both rivers flow in a general northern direction. The Buckhannon River is 45 miles long and joins the Tygart Valley River south of Philippi at the Tygart Junction. The Tygart Valley River continues its journey until it joins the West Fork River in Fairmont to form the Monongahela River, which flows into the Ohio River in Pittsburg, PA. Eventually, the water flows to the Mississippi river and empties into the Gulf of Mexico.
